# Delivery Fee Calculator

For the Wolt Intership 2023, I built a delivery fee calculator web app using React and TypeScript. The app can calculate the delivery fee taking in consideration four inputs: cart value, delivery distance, amount of items and time.
For styling the app, I used Tailwind, a utility-first CSS framework packed with classes that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup.

## Setup

You will need node and npm installed globally on your machine.

1. Unzip the folder and open it in your editor.\

2. Open the terminal and install npm packages.\
   `npm install`

3. Start the server.\
   `npm start`

4. Run the app in the development mode.\
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.\

## Test

I implement some testing to verify the values of my app.
You can find unit tests for the input and the button component.
There is also a test for all the operations, where all the posibilities for each value.
